# BPIO2

Flatbuffer types for working with the BPIO2 binmode available on the Bus Pirate 5 and
later.

This crate packages up the `flatc`-generated Rust code primarily to spare users from
edition-related conflicts and silence particular warnings caused by the generated
code.

See the [Bus Pirate documentation][docs] for information on the meaning and use of
the flatbuffer tables corresponding to the types in this crate.
